# Authentication Testing  

## Overview  
Authentication testing focuses on evaluating how the application verifies user identity. This includes assessing all authentication mechanisms, credential management, and authentication workflows to ensure they are secure against various attack vectors.  

## Objectives  
- Evaluate authentication mechanisms  
- Test password policies and management  
- Assess multi-factor authentication  
- Review session handling  
- Verify authentication bypasses  
- Test credential recovery processes  

## Key Testing Areas  

### 1. Password Authentication  
- [ ] Password Policy  
  - Complexity requirements  
  - Length requirements  
  - History requirements  
  - Common password prevention  
- [ ] Password Storage  
  - Hashing algorithms  
  - Salt implementation  
  - Key stretching  
- [ ] Login Process  
  - Brute force protection  
  - Rate limiting  
  - Account lockout  
  - Error messages  

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- [ ] MFA Implementation  
  - Setup process  
  - Recovery process  
  - Bypass methods  
- [ ] MFA Methods  
  - TOTP/HOTP  
  - SMS/Email codes  
  - Biometric  
  - Hardware tokens  
- [ ] MFA Security  
  - Token validation  
  - Replay protection  
  - Backup codes  

### 3. Authentication Flows  
- [ ] Standard Login  
  - Remember me functionality  
  - Stay logged in features  
  - Concurrent sessions  
- [ ] Social Login  
  - OAuth implementation  
  - OpenID Connect  
  - Token handling  
- [ ] API Authentication  
  - API keys  
  - JWT implementation  
  - OAuth 2.0  

### 4. Password Recovery  
- [ ] Reset Process  
  - Token security  
  - Expiration time  
  - Rate limiting  
- [ ] Recovery Methods  
  - Email recovery  
  - SMS recovery  
  - Security questions  
- [ ] Account Recovery  
  - Identity verification  
  - Audit logging  
  - Notification systems  

## Common Attack Vectors  
1. Brute Force Attacks  
2. Credential Stuffing  
3. Password Spraying  
4. MFA Bypass  
5. Session Fixation  
6. Token Theft  
7. Reset Token Manipulation  
8. Social Engineering
