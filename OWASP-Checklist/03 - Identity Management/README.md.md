# Identity Management Testing  

## Overview  
Identity Management testing focuses on evaluating how the application handles user identity throughout its lifecycle, including registration, account management, and provisioning processes. This phase ensures proper implementation of identity-related security controls.  

## Objectives  
- Evaluate user registration security  
- Test account provisioning processes  
- Assess identity verification mechanisms  
- Review profile management security  
- Verify role management implementation  

## Key Testing Areas  

### 1. User Registration  
- [ ] Registration Process Security  
  - Input validation  
  - Information disclosure  
  - Account enumeration  
  - Predictable usernames  
- [ ] Identity Verification  
  - Email verification  
  - Phone verification  
  - Document verification  
- [ ] Registration Restrictions  
  - Rate limiting  
  - IP-based controls  
  - Domain restrictions  

### 2. Account Provisioning  
- [ ] Role Assignment  
  - Default permissions  
  - Role hierarchy  
  - Privilege assignment  
- [ ] Account Creation Process  
  - Automated provisioning  
  - Manual provisioning  
  - Integration with external systems  
- [ ] Account Attributes  
  - Required fields  
  - Optional fields  
  - Sensitive data handling  

### 3. Profile Management  
- [ ] Profile Update Security  
  - Data validation  
  - Access controls  
  - Change verification  
- [ ] Profile Data Protection  
  - Data encryption  
  - Privacy controls  
  - Data minimization  
- [ ] Profile Recovery Process  
  - Password recovery  
  - Account recovery  
  - Multi-factor recovery  

### 4. Identity Correlation  
- [ ] User Uniqueness  
  - Duplicate detection  
  - Identity merging  
  - Cross-reference checking  
- [ ] Identity Federation  
  - SSO implementation  
  - Identity provider integration  
  - Token handling  

## Common Test Scenarios  
1. Multiple Account Creation  
2. Account Takeover Attempts  
3. Identity Verification Bypass  
4. Privilege Escalation via Registration  
5. Profile Update Exploitation  
6. Registration Data Manipulation  
7. Recovery Process Abuse  
8. Federation Token Manipulation

## Common Vulnerabilities  
1. Weak Registration Controls  
2. Insufficient Identity Verification  
3. Predictable Account Numbers  
4. Insecure Direct Object References  
5. Missing Account Enumeration Protection  
6. Weak Profile Recovery Process  
7. Inadequate Role Management  
8. Poor Federation Implementation  

## Testing Methodology  
1. Map Registration Flows  
2. Identify Identity Touchpoints  
3. Test Verification Methods  
4. Analyze Profile Management  
5. Assess Role Assignment  
6. Verify Federation Security  
7. Test Recovery Procedures
