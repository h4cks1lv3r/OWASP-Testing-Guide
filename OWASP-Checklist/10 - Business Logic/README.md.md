# Business Logic Testing  

## Overview  
Business logic testing focuses on evaluating the application's business rules, workflows, and processes to identify logical flaws that could be exploited. This phase ensures that business processes are implemented securely and cannot be manipulated or bypassed.  

## Objectives  
- Evaluate business process flows  
- Test transaction logic  
- Assess workflow sequences  
- Review access controls  
- Verify business rules  
- Test data validation logic  

## Key Testing Areas  

### 1. Process Flow Testing  
- [ ] Workflow Sequences  
  - Step ordering  
  - Process dependencies  
  - State transitions  
  - Completion checks  
- [ ] Transaction Logic  
  - Order processing  
  - Payment flows  
  - Account management  
  - Service provisioning  
- [ ] Access Controls  
  - Role permissions
