# Information Gathering  

## Overview  
Information gathering is the critical first phase of security testing that involves collecting comprehensive intelligence about the target web application, its infrastructure, and associated assets.  

## Objectives  
- Map the application's attack surface  
- Identify technology stack and components  
- Discover potential information leaks  
- Document application entry points  
- Understand application architecture  

## Key Testing Areas  

### 1. Search Engine Discovery  
- [ ] Google Dorking  
- [ ] Code Repository Analysis  
- [ ] Historical Data Analysis  
- [ ] Document Metadata Collection  

### 2. Fingerprinting  
- [ ] Web Server Identification  
- [ ] Technology Stack Analysis  
- [ ] Framework Detection  
- [ ] Third-party Component Analysis  

### 3. Application Mapping  
- [ ] Directory Enumeration  
- [ ] Endpoint Discovery  
- [ ] Parameter Analysis  
- [ ] API Endpoint Mapping  

### 4. Information Leakage  
- [ ] Source Code Analysis  
- [ ] Error Message Analysis  
- [ ] Comment Review  
- [ ] Metadata Extraction
